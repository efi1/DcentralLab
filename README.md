# pythonMProject

The goal of this assignment (project) is to write a Python script that automates tasks on Bitbucket, covering both UI testing
using Selenium and API testing using the Bitbucket REST API.

I accomplish its first part - a web-ui client and tests with Selenium.

This solution has a test file - test_bitbucket_activities.py - under src.tests, which contains several tests' scenarious.
The project's source reside under src folder.

The web client, as well as other clients (e.g. base_element.py) resides under src.web.clients folder.
Selenium driver should be created automatically on the first run and will be placed under src.web.drivers folder.

Tests are running under the pytest work frame.
it has a conftest.py file which initiate the client as well as calls for tearDown it the end.

Tests' global (common) args and other are placed under src.cfg.cfg_global at settings.py .
Args per a specific test, resides under src.cfg.cfg_tests, and are named by the test name itself.
"conftest.py" calls these file and load the data, which the tests utilize afterwords.

## About the web client;
it resides under src.we.clients (web_client.py).
All other related code resides under src.web. 
There are several other clients, which support the entire logic.
The  base_elements.py is more important than the other and support the web client with some additional logic, which helps
to find the elements, to wait for elements, to wrap calls coming from the client and to add them an additional functionality.
The client uses a wrapper - called "alerts_handling" (which resides in the base_elements.py) and which functions as an 
alerts/popus mitigatgor as well it returns True/False upon success/failure -> therefore it is also usable for validation.

## The API uses OAuth 2.0 
You will need both refresh_token and client_secret to instantiate the api client.

## API Client
  - The client resides under src.api.client (ManageActivities.py)
  - All api code placed under src.api.
  - The file handle_token.py (under src.api.clients), is called by the api client and responsible for getting a new 
  access token which is need fot the api secured connection.
  - The client has various REST requests which response the requested functionality as described in the assignment.
  - Each function is responsible for a specific action - create, delete, list.
  - Some of them uses data files which resides under src.api.rest_data.
  - These file are read and their content is uses to accomplish the REST calls.

## Before running the tests:
  - Create a Python virtual environment and activate it (instruction can be found later in the text below)
  - upgrade the pip package by: **python -m pip install --upgrade pip**
  - install the requirements.py by:  **pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt**
  - install setup.py by: **python -m pip install .**


## To run the tests via pytest (for both Windows and Linux)
- First, install the setup.py as mentioned above 
- To run the test via cli, while being in the **project's root tree**, type (and virtualenv is activated):
  **python -m pytest ./src --password <bitbucket password>**
=======
** python -m ./src pytest --password <bitbucket password> --refresh_token <refresh_token> --client_secret <client_secret> **

## Log files
Are written to the log folder which is under the tree root.
Each test has its own log file, under its name.
